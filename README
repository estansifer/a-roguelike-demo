Tested on GHC 6.12.3.

Requires hscurses.  (Try "cabal install hscurses".)

Run "./make.sh Roguelike" to compile.

Run "./run.sh" to run.

Don't read any of the source code or anything in the doc directory,
or it'll give away important details.

The game is designed to be played by someone who has played
a roguelike before.

The game doesn't have any particular end condition, but there is
no new material after level 10 or so.

Here is the source code for processing input, it should give
enough information to get started:

char_to_command c = case c of
   'h' -> Just $ Move (-1,  0)
   'j' -> Just $ Move ( 0,  1)
   'k' -> Just $ Move ( 0, -1)
   'l' -> Just $ Move ( 1,  0)
   'y' -> Just $ Move (-1, -1)
   'u' -> Just $ Move ( 1, -1)
   'b' -> Just $ Move (-1,  1)
   'n' -> Just $ Move ( 1,  1)
   '.' -> Just $ Move ( 0,  0)

   'd' -> Just Drink
   'r' -> Just Read
   '>' -> Just Down

   'R' -> Just RefreshScreen
